# Pet-Project

## Project Description
“Find A Furry Friend” is a web application that allows users to either find a pet to adopt or to post a pet that they wish to rehome. The application focuses on cats and dogs only. Users may also contribute supplies or monetary donations. There is a link to the ASPCA as well.

## Installation
Technologies used for this application include Node.js, Express, Mysql, Bootstrap, Handlebars and Multer.

## User Story
The application, “Find A Furry Friend”, will provide information about cats and dogs in need of adoption. Users will create an account with a username, email address and password. To login, the user will submit their email and password. After clicking on the cat or dog images, the user will be able to view pets that are available for adoption. Clicking on the submit button will allow users to post images of pets they need to rehome. For donations or contact information, the user will click on either term to find the drop-off address and contact information.
